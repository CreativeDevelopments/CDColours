## Adding Supported Languages

If you would like to contribute by adding more supported languages, please first check if the language is already supported. You can do so by visiting [here](https://docs.creativedevelopments.org/CDColours/supported-languages). If the language has not already been added then please follow the steps below.

1. Fork our repository, you can do that [here](https://github.com/CreativeDevelopments/CDColours).
2. Go to `dist/index.js` and copy from line [6](https://github.com/CreativeDevelopments/CDColours/blob/447dbee054fd974eeab06785d3929670a94c7e93/dist/index.js#L6) to line [14](https://github.com/CreativeDevelopments/CDColours/blob/447dbee054fd974eeab06785d3929670a94c7e93/dist/index.js#L14).
3. Go to line [41](https://github.com/CreativeDevelopments/CDColours/blob/447dbee054fd974eeab06785d3929670a94c7e93/dist/index.js#L41) (Note, this may change when more languages are added) and then make an ew line to paste it in.
4. Change `// English` to the language you are adding and translate all the keys (E.g. black translates to Preto in Portuguese)
5. Once everything is translated you can open a pull request for us to add it.
